# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Twitter-Data-Using-Deep-learning
In this project I have proposed one method which includes CNN and LSTM model building to analyse the sentiment of the twitter data. For the same I have given the comparison with classical Naive Bayes model and stacked RNN LSTM model. I have given the explanation why the CNN LSTM model is working good in small corpus and I have given the explanation with different analysis process.
